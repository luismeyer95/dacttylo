~ BASIC GAME STATE ~

SOLO:
    * A text file
    * One player represented by
        -> ID (name of the player)
        -> Cursor position
        -> Last input state (neutral/error)
    * Inputs are processed and matched against the character at his current cursor position:
            * advance cursor on match and set the cursor state to normal
            * otherwise do not advance the cursor and set the cursor state to error
    * The game ends when the player reaches the end of the file

RENDERING:
    * Rendering the typebox widget
        -> The local player's cursor position will be used for focus
        -> Every player's cursor position and last input state will be used to determine where to set sparse stylings and of which color (white=correct, red=wrong)
